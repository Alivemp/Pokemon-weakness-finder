# Pokemon-weakness-finder
A project I made to find a Pokemon's weakness based on the pokedex number or Pokemon name.

To use the weakness finder, you'll need to know the name or Pokédex number of the Pokémon. Once you have that, all you need to do is input the name or Pokédex number and the program will search for what you inputted and give you the Pokemon's weakness.
