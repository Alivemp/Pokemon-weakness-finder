# Pokemon-weakness-finder
A project I made to find a Pokemon's weakness based on the pokedex number or Pokemon name.

To use the weakness finder, you'll need to know the name or Pokédex number of the Pokémon. Once you have that, all you need to do is input the name or Pokédex number, and the program will search for what you input and give you the Pokemon's weakness. To end the program, type end. When it asks you if you want to search for more Pokemon, type continue and search again.
